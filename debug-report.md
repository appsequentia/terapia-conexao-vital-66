# Debug Report: CSS `@import` Order

## 1. Problem

The application build fails with the following CSS error:
`[vite:css] @import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)`

## 2. Investigation

- **Hypothesis 1: Incorrect import order.** The CSS specification requires `@import` rules to be placed at the very top of a stylesheet, before any other rules.
- **Evidence:** A `grep_search` for `@tailwind components;` located the problematic rules in `src/index.css`.
- **Analysis:** The error message explicitly points to an `@import` statement for Google Fonts appearing after `@tailwind` directives. This violates the CSS standard.

## 3. Root Cause

The root cause is the incorrect ordering of statements in `src\index.css`. The `@import url(...)` rule is positioned after other CSS rules, which is invalid.

## 4. Solution

The fix is to reorder the statements in `src/index.css` to ensure the `@import` rule is the first declaration in the file.

- **Before:**
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  @import url('...');
  ```

- **After:**
  ```css
  @import url('...');
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

This change will resolve the build error and ensure the CSS is valid.

# Debug Report: White Screen

## 1. Problem

The application renders a blank white screen upon loading. The browser console shows no critical errors, only a warning about using Stripe over HTTP.

## 2. Investigation

- **Hypothesis 1: Routing Mismatch.** The current URL path might not be handled by the application's router.
- **Hypothesis 2: Main Component Failure.** The root component (`App` or similar) is failing to render, possibly due to a data fetching issue or an internal error.
- **Hypothesis 3: Stripe Integration.** The Stripe.js warning, while not an error, could indicate a misconfiguration that blocks rendering if it's a critical dependency.

**Initial Action:** Analyze the project structure to identify the main entry point and routing configuration.

## 3. Root Cause (Revised)

The initial fix addressed a symptom, but the true root cause was in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`. The main `useEffect` hook responsible for handling authentication state had `location.pathname` in its dependency array. This caused the entire authentication logic (including setting up the `onAuthStateChange` listener) to re-run on every single route change. This created a persistent race condition, where the user's state was constantly being reset and re-evaluated, leading to unpredictable rendering and the persistent white screen.

## 4. Solution (Definitive)

The definitive fix was to remove `location.pathname` from the dependency array of the `useEffect` in `AuthContext`. This ensures the authentication logic is initialized only *once* when the `AuthProvider` is first mounted. This change stabilizes the authentication state, eliminates the race condition, and resolves the white screen issue permanently.
