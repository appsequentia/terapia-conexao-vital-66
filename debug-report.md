# Debug Report: CSS `@import` Order

## 1. Problem

The application build fails with the following CSS error:
`[vite:css] @import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)`

## 2. Investigation

- **Hypothesis 1: Incorrect import order.** The CSS specification requires `@import` rules to be placed at the very top of a stylesheet, before any other rules.
- **Evidence:** A `grep_search` for `@tailwind components;` located the problematic rules in `src/index.css`.
- **Analysis:** The error message explicitly points to an `@import` statement for Google Fonts appearing after `@tailwind` directives. This violates the CSS standard.

## 3. Root Cause

The root cause is the incorrect ordering of statements in `src\index.css`. The `@import url(...)` rule is positioned after other CSS rules, which is invalid.

## 4. Solution

The fix is to reorder the statements in `src/index.css` to ensure the `@import` rule is the first declaration in the file.

- **Before:**
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  @import url('...');
  ```

- **After:**
  ```css
  @import url('...');
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

This change will resolve the build error and ensure the CSS is valid.
